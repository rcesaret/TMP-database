Some sites subsume one or more 'subsites', and in such cases, the subsites usually constitute the collection tracts that were defined and used by fieldworkers.Most sites were defined on the basis of visible architectural remains; a minority are based on spatial units that relate to recent or modern land-use practices. Site numbers are mostly integers, but some sites have the prefix ""L"". This indicates that the site was judged to lack significant evidence for occupation during the Teotihuacan Period, although there was evidence of earlier and/or later occupation; these determinations were sometimes later revised. Published references to TMP sites and subsites may use colons and subscripts that are not part of this database.
