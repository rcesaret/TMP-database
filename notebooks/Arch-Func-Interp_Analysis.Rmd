Also, a more general research project aimed at reviewing, editing and refining the architectural and functional interpretations of the TMP data was conducted. This work began under 
      Huster & Dennehey, 
      The work of Norwood on Plazas
      Sherfield's aborted dissertation research 
      Cesaretti and Blumenfeld (Blumenfeld et al 2024) 
This endeavour involved the creation of the following tables:
    -- "a_FuncInterp1 for digitization"
    -- "a_FuncInterp1"
    -- "z_archInterp1"
    -- "z_archInterp2"
    -- "z_funcInterp1"
    -- "z_funcInterp2"
    -- "1WorkingHierarchy"
    -- "HierarchyCode"
